            <h2>ABOUT THE LEGEND</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India.</p>
            <p>Gandhi's father, Karamchand Gandhi, was the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar, and his mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious woman who influenced Gandhi's spiritual development. At the age of 13, Gandhi was married to Kasturba Makhanji in an arranged marriage. Despite the challenges of early marriage, Kasturba remained a steadfast companion and supporter throughout his life.</p>
            <p>In 1888, Gandhi traveled to London to study law at University College London. Upon completing his studies, he returned to India in 1891, but struggled to establish a legal practice. In 1893, he accepted a one-year contract to work as a lawyer in South Africa, where he faced blatant racial discrimination that deeply affected him and shaped his social and political views.</p>
            <p>During his time in South Africa, Gandhi developed his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha, and led several campaigns against discriminatory laws. He returned to India in 1915, where he joined the Indian National Congress and became a prominent leader in the fight for independence.</p>
            <p>Gandhi's leadership in the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Salt March, and the Quit India Movement played a crucial role in mobilizing millions of Indians towards the goal of self-rule. Despite numerous arrests and hardships, Gandhi remained committed to his principles of nonviolence and truth.</p>
            <p>On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, while on his way to a prayer meeting in New Delhi. His legacy continues to inspire movements for justice and peace worldwide.</p>
